# Dictionary App Project

---

This project is aimed at building a frontend application that helps users search for the meanings of words and keeps track of their search history. The app will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and will make use of the following API for getting the meaning of words:

`https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<word>`

### Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create a platform where people can search for specific words and save them in a search history to read them later. The application will have two pages: the search words page and the history page. The search words page will have an input field and a search button. When the user enters a word and clicks the search button, a word card will be generated containing the meaning of that word. The history page will display all the words that have been searched, and each word card will have a delete button to remove it from the search history.

### Tech Stack Prerequisite

This project requires the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Project Steps

The project will be divided into the following steps:

#### Step 1: Set up the project

In this step, we will set up the folder structure for the project, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. We may also include some images that will be required in the application.

#### Step 2: The search words page

The search words page will be the first page that the user sees when opening the application. This page will contain an input field and a search button. When the user enters a word and clicks the search button, a word card will be generated containing the meaning of that word. When the user clicks the history button, they will be directed to the history page.

#### Step 3: The history page

The history page will display all the words that have been searched. Each word card will contain the word and its meaning, and a delete button to remove it from the search history.

#### Step 4: Saving data to localStorage

To keep the application up to date, we will store the search history in localStorage. Whenever a new word is searched, an object containing the word and its meaning will be pushed to the respective array, and the array will be saved to localStorage.

### Project Checkpoints

The following are the project checkpoints:

- The search button
- The history page button
- The search page button
- The delete button

These checkpoints will help ensure that the project is on track and meeting the expected requirements.

### Conclusion

The Dictionary App project is aimed at building a platform where users can search for words and their meanings and keep track of their search history. With this project, we hope to create an application that is simple, easy to use, and helps people expand their vocabulary.
